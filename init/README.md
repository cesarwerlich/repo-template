# Project Name

Short description of what this project does, who it serves, and why it exists.

## Quick Start

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
./scripts/check.sh
```

If the project needs environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Project Context

Read these first (kept small on purpose):

- `CONTEXT.md` - purpose, architecture, constraints, and local commands.
- `TASKS.md` - current objective, active work, and handoff between sessions.
- `DECISIONS.md` - accepted decisions still in force.
- `AGENTS.md` - the canonical contract for AI coding agents.

Read on demand:

- `docs/roadmap.md` - priorities and open questions.
- `docs/memory.md` - durable facts, traps, and compiled Q&A.
- `docs/journal.md` - chronological notes and discussion outcomes.
- `docs/testing.md` / `docs/evals.md` - verification and benchmark notes.
- `docs/agents/lane-protocol.md` - issue lanes, worktrees, and coordinator rules when multiple agents work in parallel.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `ANTIGRAVITY.md` - thin tool wrappers that point back to `AGENTS.md`.

## Common Commands

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh  # install/setup what this repo needs
./scripts/check.sh      # run stack-aware verification
# optional: lane/worktree helpers (requires Node.js for lane-update.mjs)
AGENT_TOOL=claude ./scripts/worktree-bootstrap.sh <issue-n> <slug>
node ./scripts/lane-update.mjs --help
```
