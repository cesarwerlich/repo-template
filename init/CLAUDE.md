# Claude Instructions

Read `AGENTS.md` first. This file exists for Claude-oriented tools that prefer `CLAUDE.md`.

## Default Workflow

1. Ground in `CONTEXT.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `MEMORY.md`.
2. Inspect the current implementation before making claims.
3. Use relevant `.agents/skills/` workflows when they help.
4. Make focused changes.
5. Run `./scripts/check.sh` when relevant.
6. Update `MEMORY.md` for durable decisions or traps.

## Boundaries

- Do not overwrite user work.
- Do not commit secrets.
- Do not invent missing project facts; record unknowns in `ROADMAP.md` or ask.
